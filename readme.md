Hey doobers:
Here's what you should do after you checkout this repo for the first time:
0) install python3 if you haven't already
1) `C:> pyvenv lang_gen_venv`
    This will set up a virtual environment for this project. DO IT. You can call it something besides lang_gen_venv, but just fucking do it, ok?
2) `C:> lang_gen_venv/Scripts/activate.bat`
    This will 'activate' your virtual environment, so you can use the proper packages and python version without having to think about it
3) `C:> python3 nltk/setup.py`
    This will install NLTK 3.0a3, the latest version of NLTK 3, which is Py3k compatible. `pip3 install nltk` won't cut it, since they haven't released a stable version of NLTK 3 on PyPi yet.

If you guys could have this done by Saturday, that'd be great! GO TEAM!
